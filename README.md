## üöÄ Components

### App Switcher

Rapidly switch between open windows of the same app using a single shortcut. Much faster than using the default Windows Task Switcher.

For example using `RAlt + N` will switch between all open Notepad windows in turn with the most recently used Notepad window first. 

Customise the script to add all your favourite applications.

### Dynamic Shortcuts

Are you constantly switching between windows and then having to find the open window again? This script enables you to dynamically assign a shortcut to the currently active window so that you can easily switch back to it with a single shortcut.

Use `RAlt + Shift + {num}` to assign a shortcut to the current active window. Then use `RAlt + {num}` to switch back to that window at anytime.

### Editing Keys

Switches all character keys on the keyboard to become navigational for faster editing without having to move your hands off the home row. For example `J` becomes `Down`, `K` becomes `Up`.

Press `RAlt` to toggle between keyboard modes.

### App Opener

Adds shortcuts to open a new instance of a specified app. For example, set `RAlt + F1` to open a new browser window using a specific profile.

### Windows Management

Adds hotkeys for common Windows management

- `RAlt + Esc`:  Close window
- `RAlt + +`: Maximise window
- `RAlt + -`: Minimise window
- `Right Alt + BackTick`: Move window between monitors

### Paste Without Formatting

When `Ctrl + Shift + V` is pressed the script will paste the current clipboard contents as plain text with all formatting removed.

This functionality has since been added to [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/paste-as-plain-text)

### KeyMappings

A place to add common key mappings.

- `Caps Lock` => `Ctrl`


## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Auto Hotkey v1.x must be installed. For installation details see their [website](https://www.autohotkey.com) or install via Windows Package Manager.

```PowerShell
winget install -e --id AutoHotkey.AutoHotkey
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order for some of the scripts to [correctly function with UWP app windows](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/FAQ.htm#uac), you must be running the [UIA version of AutoHotkey.](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess)
> 
> To run the UIA version:
> - From the installer (`c:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\installer.ahk`).
> - Select modify, 64 bit, then select the option to `Add 'Run with UI Access' to context menus`.

### Running

1. Clone the repository to a local directory.
2. Run `Startup.ahk`.

### Enable on Start Up

1. Create a Windows shortcut to the UIA version of AutoHotkey. Append the path of `Startup.ahk` to the target. The target should look something like:

`"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkeyU64_UIA.exe" "C:\MyGitPath\ahk-scripts\Startup.ahk"`

2. Place the shortcut in the `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` directory.


## üìù Making Changes  
  
The scripts avoid adding hotkeys to specific applications. To add your favourite apps the following scripts should be modified. See the comments within the scripts for more details.
### App Switcher

1. Add an app group under the `RegisterAppSwitcherGroups` function.
```
GroupAdd, Notepad, ahk_exe notepad.exe ; Notepad
```
2. Add a hotkey
```
RAlt & n:: ActivateAppGroup("Notepad", AppDataLocal . "c:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe")
```

### App Opener

1. Add your hotkey mappings to lunch a new app window to the end of the file.

### Key Mappings

1. Add your hotkey mappings to the end of the file.


## üéØ Roadmap

- Support v2 of Auto Hotkey.


## ü™Ñ Contributing

Additions, improvements and feedback are all welcome. 

The general rule is that I've tried to keep the scripts helpful for everyone. So instead of including a script with a hotkey to **my** favourite app, the script should allow setting a hotkey to **any** app.
